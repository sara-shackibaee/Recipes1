Store in a cool, dark place for at least a month, giving it a shake every few days for the first week or so to mix everything together and dissolve the sugar.',
            'Check the flavour after a month and continue to infuse if you prefer a stronger flavour – it can be left for up to three months. Or, add another 50g sugar and leave for two or three weeks if you prefer it sweeter. When you’re happy with the flavour, strain the gin through a fine mesh cloth or muslin into a clean bottle and discard the fruit (you can also eat the boozy plums alongside sponge cakes or ice cream). Store in a cool, dark place. Drink on its own, in a G&T or mix with lemon juice and sugar syrup for a plum gin sour.'
